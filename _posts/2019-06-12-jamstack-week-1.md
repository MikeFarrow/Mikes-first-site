## The early days of web

This post outlines my first week with the JAMstack and how I set up a new business. It all began on the Monday with a job email which I wasn't particularly interested in but it did contain the phrase 'must be experienced with JAMstack'. I recognised all the other skill requirements in the job outline, so I thought I would do a bit of research.

It was a bit like the Narnia wardrobe, the more I read the more I became fascinated with JAMstack. To fully understand the appeal you have to know a bit about where I was coming from, I am getting close to twenty five years in web development. 

At first I loved it, it was so easy to create content and the reach was global, these were heady days. Microsoft had not entered the market, they were still trying to convince us that real businesses would not use the internet as it was too 'out there', they would use MSN, Microsoft's little walled garden. ASP was another two years down the line, when they finally started to wake up.

Setting a server up was a different matter, it cost a fortune and no one knew how to do it. We formed a collective of fifteen techies, put a Â£1,000 each in and set up HubCom, one of the UK's first web companies. So basically content was easy, hardware was hard.



## Web in 2019

What a difference it is today, even setting up something simple like a WordPress blog requires a LAMP stack, an understanding of CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript and maybe PHP. You have the nightmare of managing security, understanding plugins and the horrible process of making sure all of your versions are compatible.

That is for a simple system, if you need a bit more control or want to integrate with backend systems then you need to get into some deep tech. A Javascript framework will be necessary for all but the simplest of setups, so first which one? React, AngularJS, VueJS, vanilla Angular, perhaps TypeScript, probably Babel so you can target older browsers, SCSS, SASS, LESS or Stylus to preprocess your CSS and something really complex like Webpack to bundle your code and maybe do a bit of splitting. All this before you even start to look at libraries and plugins to handle stuff like charting, time handling or a million other things.

If you actually manage to get most of those things working together and you start adding testing to keep it all stable and chuck in some continuous integration to make getting it live a little less painful. The absolute last thing you will want to do, is develop some functioning code as that will bring the whole house of cards crashing down.

## Getting stuff done

So what do you do if you just want to implement some functionality or create a simple Minimum Viable Product? Fortunately the good part of 2019 is that there are some amazing online resources that let you work in a sandbox without having to set up a complete development stack. The original ones like JSFiddle and Plunker let you do bits of HTML, CSS and JavaScript then share the link for others to copy and learn from. \

The next major step was sites like CodePen which added a social dimension. You would have a profile page to present your online Pens like a GitHub account. Another treat was the picked pens, which showed the top Pens posted that day by a host of web developer glitterati such as [Sarah Drasner](https://codepen.io/sdras/) and Chris Collier (one of the sites originators). CodePen is similar to JSFiddle and Plunker in that you would have three panels for HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then an output area to see the results of running your code.

The next big step in this goodness came with sites like Glitch, StackBlitz and CodeSandBox which gave you almost a full development environment in the browser. The last two used an online VSCode implementation and Glitch by the owners of Stack Overflow created their own thing with a full visual version control built in. These products also offered more of a full stack experience letting you add a server component to your creation.

So whereas the original tools offered a way to share code examples and seek help for a bug on Stack Overflow, the full stackers offered a complete development experience in a modern browser but where do you go next? You still had to save your code to a local disc or GitHub and then build a devOps chain around it.
