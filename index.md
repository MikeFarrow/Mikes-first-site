      I am very experienced front end web developer with just under twenty five
      years building interactive and dynamic web. I am passionate about the web
      and its potential to change the planet and hopefully save us from the
      sorry mess we have arrived at.


      My core beliefs lie in radical simplicity and inclusivity, I love being
      outside in nature and believe that England has some of the best
      countryside and coastline in the world. My other big passion is dancing
      and I try to practice 12 to 16 hours a week.
